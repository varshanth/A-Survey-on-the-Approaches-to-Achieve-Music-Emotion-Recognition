# A-Survey-on-the-Approaches-to-Achieve-Music-Emotion-Recognition

Music and emotions have been proven to be tightly coupled and by tagging songs with the possible emotions it is associated to, it would become possible to apply this to various fields of study like psychological analysis, effect of music on social dynamics, situation based recommendations etc. MER is a field of affective computing which can be used for optimizing music retrieval (emotional state based storage & retrieval), delivering personalized context based music recommendations, development of efficient music therapies etc. MER has matured from a coarse classification problem into a granular regression problem. There are many proposed methods to solve MER through various machine learning & deep learning algorithms.
